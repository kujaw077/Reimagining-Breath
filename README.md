## Computer Vision Stuff (Eulerian Video Magnification)
[Original EVM paper](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/) (has Matlab code too)

### In this repository:
[`./Live-Video-Magnification`](https://github.com/tschnz/Live-Video-Magnification) (see README in there for details): 
An OpenCV/Qt based realtime application for Eulerian Video Magnification. Works with multiple videos and cameras at the same time and let's you export the magnified videos.

### Potential things:
A [python version](https://github.com/hbenbel/Eulerian-Video-Magnification) exists, but it had a memory leak and crashed for me.
